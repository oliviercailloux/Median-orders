= Median orders

The autor of the files posted here is Alain GÃ©noche. I publish them on this website with his autorization (given by e-mail on the 23rd of May, 2017).

The program Kemeny.c, given a tournament, builds a few approximate median orders and tries to build an optimal one.

The data file must be in a Data sub-folder. The .tour extension is mandatory. The SFBI.tour contains the data talked about in the article. Has20.tour is a random tournament.
